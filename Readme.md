## Project structure
Visualize.js documentation project consists of 3 parts:
- **jsfiddle examples** - this is basically set of folders with jsfiddle examples. 
  We are using [jsfiddle github integration][jsfiddle github integration]
  to show jsfiddle examples from our github repo. So if new sample should be added - read [add new jsfiddle sample](#add-new-jsfiddle-sample) section
- **slatedocs** - [visualize.js docs page][online documentation] 
  is written using [slatedocs/slate][slatedocs] template. So if visualize document itself
  should be updated - read [this](#slatedocs) section
- **github pages** - final result of the documentation made public using [github pages][github pages],
    namely `gh-pages` branch is used to show public documentation site

## Folders structure
This github project has the following structure:
```
|-<ahv-*> - ad hoc view samples
|-<dashboard-*> - dashboard samples
|-<inputControl-*> - input control samples
|-<report-*> - report samples
|-JasperServerResources - JasperReports Server export catalog with resources necessary to run these samples
|-resources - JasperReports Server export catalog with resources necessary to run these samples
|-slatedocs - documentation build system
```
## JSFiddle samples
JSFiddle is basically a folder which has the following structure:
```
|-demo.css
|-demo.html
|-demo.js
|-demo.details
```
Content of `demo.{css,html,js}` files will be visible in the appropriate window of the jsfiddle live example.
Read [jsfiddle integration][jsfiddle github integration] for more details

### Add new jsfiddle sample
- add a subfolder under necessary samples group (`adhoc view`, `dashboard`, `inputControl`, `report` etc. 
  see [Folders structure](#folders-structure))
- add `demo.*` files with actual sample content to this folder
- integrate this sample into the documentation itself: see [How to update documentation](#how-to-update-documentation)

## Slatedocs
[slatedocs][slatedocs] is used to generate [online documentation][online documentation].
All files related to `slatedocs` are placed under `slatedocs` folder.

### Slatetdocs folder structure
```
|-lib
|-source
|  |-fonts
|  |-images
|  |-includes
|  |-javascripts
|  |-layout
|  |-stylesheets
|  |-index.html.md
|-*.*
```

`index.html.md` - this is the actual file which should be modified in order to update documentation.
In most cases you do not have to change any other files in the `slatedocs` folder

### Build docs
The simplest way to build documentation is to use `docker`:
- install [docker][docker]
- execute 
  ```shell
    cd ./slatedocs
    docker run --rm --name slate -v $(pwd)/build:/srv/slate/build -v $(pwd)/source:/srv/slate/source slatedocs/slate
  ```
  Build result will be generated to `slatedocs/build` folder.
- Now open this file `slatedocs/build/index.html` - you should see your documentation 

For using Slate in native OS run next command in `slatedocs` folder:
  ```shell
    bundle exec middleman build
  ```

For other ways to build documentation - see slate [getting started][slatedocs getting started] docs

### Start dev server
The simplest way to build documentation is to use `docker`:
- install [docker][docker]
- execute
  ```shell
    cd ./slatedocs
    docker run --rm --name slate -p 4567:4567 -v $(pwd)/source:/srv/slate/source slatedocs/slate serve
  ```
- Now open [http://127.0.0.1:4567](http://127.0.0.1:4567) - you should see documentation in your browser
- Every time you will do changes in the `slatedocs/sources` folder - changes will be available in the browser after 
  page refresh

For using Slate in native OS run next command in `slatedocs` folder:
  ```shell
    bundle exec middleman server
  ```
after that on the console you would see the URL to running server.

For other ways to run standalone server - see slate [getting started][slatedocs getting started] docs

### Update slatedocs template to the latest version
Template is slightly changed but generally it should be easy to update slate template to the latest version
if necessary. To update template:
- clone original [slatedocs repo][slatedocs]
- copy all files and folders from the cloned repo except `.github` and `source/index.html.md` to `slatedocs` 
  folder and replace files if they exists
- copy `.github` folder from the cloned repo to the root `.github` folder and replace files if they exists.
- use some git diff tool to inspect difference and merge changes.

## Github pages
[Github pages][github pages] used to make documentation site available online.
To update documentation fork this repo and set up github pages to be served from a `gh-pages` branch:
- In the forked project go to the settings tab and scroll down to the `Github Pages` section.
- Then select `gh-pages` branch as a source and click `save`
- After this your site should be available at this url: `https://<username>.github.io/js-visualize/`

## Github actions
[Github actions][github actions] are used to automatically build and deploy the public site.
Two actions: `Build` and `Deploy` are created:
- `Build` action runs on push/pull request to any branch and makes sure that documentation
  build process executed successfully
- `Deploy` action runs on push to the `master` branch.
   It executes documentation build process and then 
   it executes push of the `slatedocs/buld` folder to the `gh-pages` branch which
   updates the public documentation if [Github pages](#github-pages) has been set up.

## How to update documentation
- Fork this repo
- Set up [Github pages](#github-pages) for your fork  
- If you already forked the repo earlier - [reset](#how-to-reset-your-fork-to-mirror-original-repo) 
  your fork's `master` branch to mirror the original repo's `master` branch  
- Make necessary changes to the `slatedocs/source/index.html.md` file in your fork
- If new jsfiddle sample should be added or updated - [do necessary changes](#add-new-jsfiddle-sample) as well
- Test changes by [running build](#build-docs) or by using [dev server](#start-dev-server)
- Once changes are completed - push them to github (forked repo)
- Wait until github actions will be completed - visit `https://github.com/<username>/js-visualize/actions` to see all actions
- Test your documentation changes on the public site: `https://<username>.github.io/js-visualize/`
- Create PR from the forked `master` branch to the original visualize docs repo's `master` branch.
- Create PR from the forked `gh-pages` branch to the original visualize docs repo's `gh-pages` branch.
  (this step could be omitted once github actions will work for the original visualize docs repo)

### How to reset your fork to mirror original repo
- checkout `master` branch
- add new git remote to your fork to reference the original repo (if not done yet):
  ```shell
  git remote add vizdocs git@github.com:TIBCOSoftware/js-visualize.git  
  ```
- fetch changes from the original repo:
  ```shell
  git fetch vizdocs master
  ```
- hard reset your branch to the `master` branch of the original repo:
  ```shell
  git reset --hard vizdocs/master
  ```
- after this it might be necessary to do a force push `master` branch of your fork:
  ```shell
  git push origin master --force
  ```
